TJM Symfony boilerplate
========================

This is based upon [Symfony Standard Edition](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard.git), modified for my (Toby Mackenzie's) needs.

It was originally intented to use a separate package to contain as much of the standard edition code, config, etc. as possible to allow easily updating versions.  As the Symfony upgrade process has simplified, this has become less necessary, and I've been gradually removing some of that.  The focus has reduced to mostly a starting point for my personal Symfony projects.

This project is in flux as I decide what it should become with the incoming [Symfony 4 directory structure](http://fabien.potencier.org/symfony4-directory-structure.html) and other changes to the project and my personal preferences.
